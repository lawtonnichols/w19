Even though this is my first time tutoring for a class, CS16 is very fresh in my mind, and also I remember most of the questions/problems I’ve had myself as a student, and I would love to share my knowledge with you and help you succeed. You can reach out to me in labs, during open lab hours, and on Piazza. Looking forward to being your excellent resource!" </i>

  <h3> Diego Segundo (Tutor)</h3>
    Preferred Pronouns: He, Him, His<br/>
  <i> "Hi, my name is Diego Segundo and I’m a 4th year computer science major originally from Huntington Beach California. I first was introduced to coding in high school and was drawn towards the creative aspect of coding and how there are so many different ways to solve one problem. For the last couple years I have worked as a web developer at the Daily Nexus (which is a school newspaper here at ucsb). I originally started mentoring in the spring of last year, and think that it is a great program that provides undergraduates with an extra opportunity to help them understand the course material. So far I have mentored for CS8 and CS56 (both for Professor Conrad). Outside of school my hobbies include playing basketball and surfing. This is my first quarter mentoring for cs16 and I am really looking forward to it!" </i>

    Preferred Pronouns: He, Him, His<br/>
  <i> "Hey everyone! My name is Dylan and my pronouns are he/him/his. I'm a second year in Computer Science major and I'm super excited to be a mentor for everyone this quarter. Currently, I'm researching tradeoffs of neural networks within hardware in the Computer Architecture Lab under professor Sheerwood. Besides for progamming, I'm extremely active within our local labor movement and enjoy studying the political economy in my free time. To be successful and learn more in this course, I highly recommend taking  advantage of office hours as you never know what you might learn inside them. Otherwise, feel free to contact me and ask any questions you may have!" </i>

  <h3> Jacqueline Mai (Tutor) </h3> 
    Preferred Pronouns: She, Her, Hers<br/>
  <i> "Hi everyone! I'm Jacqui and I'm a second-year Computer Science major. I'm really excited to be tutoring this class, since I love helping people learn new things. CS16 was the first CS course I took at UCSB, and one of my first programming courses ever, so I definitely remember some of the challenges. Feel free to ask me as many questions as you need in order to understand the new concepts, and I will help you as best as I can. Some other background about me: I'm currently on track to finish my undergraduate degree a year early, and I'm in the process of applying for the combined BS/MS program. As part of the ERSP undergraduate research program, I'm working with Professor Tim Sherwood of the ArchLab to study the tradeoffs of incorporating neural networks into hardware. Don't hesitate to talk to me or contact me privately via Piazza if you need to set up an extra meeting outside my lab hours, or if you want to talk to me about undergraduate research or graduating early!" </i>

I'm excited to meet you all this winter quarter and help to further your programming skills. C++ might seem a little daunting at first, but don't let this stop you; I'm here to help you excel in the course, so ask away! In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, taking walks around campus, making terrible jokes (ask at your own expense!), and playing ping pong at the Santa Rosa Residence Hall. :)  " </i>

    Preferred Pronouns: He, Him, His<br/>
  <i> "Hi! My name is Joseph, but everyone has always called me by my nickname, Yossi. I am a third year CS major and I am very excited to be one of your tutors for CS16. I worked as a tutor in high school as well, and I loved finding ways to make some of the same topics that I struggled with in a class less confusing for the next generation. I took CS16 during my freshman year here, so I hope to be able to help in this same way. I actually started at UCSB as a Mechanical Engineering major but found (eventually) that CS was much better for me, so I can help with many questions regarding major switching, especially into the CS department. Also, I love helping people see how to approach problems algorithmically in a way that a computer can understand, as this knowledge will help in all CS classes, and in any programming language. Outside of school, I love surfing, mountain biking, and playing with my two dogs. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me with any questions on Piazza." </i>
